  // We have one serializer/deserializer for each locally-hosted Vat, so
  // it shared among all peer Vats.

  // A FarVow (specifically a Vow in the 'far' state) can be used to send
  // remote messages: v.e.foo(1,2) will queue an invocation of
  // target.foo(1,2) on whatever target object the vow eventually resolves
  // to. Each Vow (including FarVows) have their own identity: creating two
  // (resolved) Vows from the same object will yield entirely different Vows.
  // So if you have two Vows and want to ask if they point at the same thing,
  // you must use .then(), wait for the callback to fire with a Presence,
  // then compare the Presences instead. This callback will fire on a
  // subsequent turn without doing network IO, since FarVows are already
  // resolved (unlike RemoteVows or LocalVows).

  // A Presence represents a specific remote object (on a specific Vat). You
  // get one by calling .then() on a some Vow (other than a NearVow, which
  // will resolve to local object, or a BrokenVow, which resolves to an
  // error), and then waiting until the callback fires. Presences can be
  // compared for EQ, but you can't send messages on them. To send messages,
  // turn the Presence into a FarVow by using Vow.resolve(p) .

  // Vow states:
  // * near: resolved, points to a local object
  // * far: resolved, points to an object on some other vat
  // * local: unresolved, no idea what it will resolve to
  // * remote: unresolved, but some other vat has a LocalVow that is a better
  //   place to queue messages than us
  // * broken

  // Vow transfers:
  // * sending a pass-by-reference object results in a Presence. Sending that
  //   Presence elsewhere results in another Presence. Sending a Presence to
  //   its home vat results in the original object reference (EQ to the
  //   starting point)
  // * sending a NearVow results in a FarVow. Sending that FarVow elsewhere
  //   results in another FarVow. Sending a FarVow to its home vat results in
  //   a new NearVow (not EQ to the original): using .then() on both will
  //   yield the same object.
  // * sending a LocalVow results in a RemoteVow. Sending that RemoteVow
  //   elsewhere is currently an error. Sending that RemoteVow to its home
  //   vat is currently an error. (ideally sending it elsewhere yields a
  //   RemoteVow, and sending it back home results in the original LocalVow,
  //   but it isn't clear how hard this might be)

  // When sending a NearVow, the comms layer will need to know the resolution
  // object, so it can assign a swissnum that can be used by the receiving
  // side to build a Presence that points to the same object. This will
  // always occur in the context of an outbound message, when the FarHandler
  // delivers the (op, args) event to the comms layer. We put an extra
  // argument into this function call to give the comms layer a way to ask
  // about NearVow->object mappings.

  // We currently define three operations: Send(targetID, op, args,
  // resolverID), SendOnly(targetID, op, args), and Resolve(resolverID, val).

  // Each side of a pairwise comms connection maintains a "resolution table",
  // mapping a resolutionID to a Resolver that should be invoked upon receipt
  // of a Resolve() operation. In practice there will be one table for the
  // whole comms layer, but it is indexed by (peerVatID, resolutionID).
  // Inbound Resolve() operations *from* VatA may only access rows with
  // peerVatID==VatA. This requires the transport layer to reliably indicate
  // the origin of an inbound connection.

  // When an object in VatA does y = b.foo(), y is a new LocalVow created by
  // the comms layer (ish). The comms layer allocates a random unguessable
  // resolverID and puts the new resolver into the resolution table, and
  // includes the resolverID in the Send() operation. The receiver
  // deserializes the arguments, looks up the target, invokes the named
  // operation, and inspects the result. If the result is an immediate value,
  // it sends (really it queues until after checkpoint) a Resolve() operation
  // with the resolverID and value. If the result is a Promise, it attaches a
  // .then() callback to do the same.

  // if an object in VatA has a LocalVow 'x' (todo: maybe of any type) and
  // includes it as an argument like b.foo(x), then the comms layer assigns a
  // new swissnum (if 'x' has not been sent anywhere before). It attaches a
  // .then() callback to the object, so when that fires in the future, it
  // sends a Resolve(swissnum, val) operation to the remote side. When the
  // receiver deserializes the argument into a RemoteVow, it adds the
  // swissnum into its resolution table.

  // The resolution table thus contains rows allocated by the local side
  // (when sending a resolver, in the specific case of a message-send that is
  // not a SendOnly), and rows allocated by the far side (when receiving a
  // RemoteVow).
