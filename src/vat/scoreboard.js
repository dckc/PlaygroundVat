/**
 * A scoreboard is an object that accepts proto messages, where each
 * proto message is already authenticated as being a signed
 * message-with-sequence-number from some component of a composite
 * identity. Each proto message is evidence towards an actual message
 * from that composite identity. When the set of authenticated
 * componentIDs of components agreeing on that message passes the
 * quorumTest predicate of that compositeID, the scoreboard concludes
 * that the composite designated by that compositeID has sent that
 * message.
 *
 * Our caller must only provide us with information that has already
 * been authenticated as a message from that componentID with that
 * sequence number. The msgID must be a value that is one-to-one with
 * the msg, such as a cryptographic hash of the contents of the
 * message. The scoreboard compares these msgIDs with Map and ===, but
 * never compares the messages themselves.
 *
 * The quorumTest predicate must be pure and monotonic. By pure, it
 * should not cause or be sensitive to any effects; it must not modify
 * or remember the set it is passed. By monotonic, if it says true for
 * set X, it must say true for any superset of set X.
